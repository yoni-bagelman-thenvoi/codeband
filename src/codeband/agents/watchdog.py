        The stall rung counts an absent transition + an absent git-HEAD change
        across ``max_phase_visits`` patrols as a substantive stall. A transport
        pin on the FSM-expected actor presents the same symptoms (the agent's
        delivery queue is wedged at the head, so no FSM advance is possible
        until the pin clears). Without this gate, a pinned actor was getting
        marked ``blocked`` — and ``blocked`` poisons recovery because the only
        legal exit needs a Conductor resume (not auto-triggered).

        Algorithm:

        1. Resolve the set of FSM-expected roles for ``sub.state`` via
           :func:`state_to_roles`. Terminal states → no expected actor →
           proceed.
        2. Take every agent of those roles that has a REST client (i.e. is
           reachable from the watchdog).
        3. For each, probe the agent's own delivery queue in the task's room
           with the SAME pin criteria as the heal rung (processing record OR
           pending head with ``inserted_at`` older than
           ``transport_pin_threshold_seconds``).
        4. Any candidate pinned — or any probe that raises — DEFERS the
           block. Probe uncertainty fails toward defer because a false block
           poisons recovery; a transient transport error just delays a real
           block one patrol.

        ``review_passed`` returns ``{verifier, mergemaster}`` and both are
        probed: the v1 approximation can over-defer when a subtask is actually
        waiting on the verifier while the mergemaster is independently pinned
        on another room, but the cost is a bounded delay of the block, never a
        wrong block. ``required_verdicts`` is intentionally not consulted
        here.

        No-ops to ``False`` (proceed) when:

        * the transport-heal rung is disabled — the operator opted out of the
          composition, so the discriminator opts out too;
        * no per-agent REST clients are wired — nothing to probe with;
        * the task's room cannot be resolved — the pin lookup is per-room and
          we cannot tell, fall through to today's behavior;
        * no candidate agent of the expected role has a REST client — also
          nothing to probe with.

        Only ``self._role_map`` membership + room scoping are used (not
        ``assigned_agent_id``); probing a non-participant returns an empty
        mailbox for the room, so non-participants cannot cause a false defer.

        the delivery falls back into the ``pending`` bucket head-of-queue and
        the agent's cursor is pinned — the agent will not pull the next message
        because the transport layer sees the old delivery as still unprocessed.
        A chat nudge cannot wake a pinned agent (its cursor is wedged below
        the new message).

        This rung probes BOTH buckets per (agent, room):
        - ``pending`` (post-turn 422 class): 2-step re-open (``/processing``)
          then complete (``/processed``), verified by re-listing the head.
          Cursor advance confirmed by re-list = success; same head = failed
          attempt; verify error = unknown (retry next patrol).
        - ``processing`` (crash-during-turn class): 1-step ``/processed``
          re-assert. A 422 here means the delivery is already processed;
          treated as a benign idempotent no-op.

        Only deliveries whose ``inserted_at`` is older than
        ``transport_pin_threshold_seconds`` are considered pins — this T is
        LONGER than any plausible real turn (default 1800s), so mid-turn
        deliveries are never touched.

        Per-agent REST clients are required because both the probes and the
        heals act on the calling agent's own delivery row — the Conductor's
        credentials only see/heal the Conductor's deliveries. The watchdog
        runs on the Conductor's credential; its entry in ``agent_rest_clients``
        is swept like any other agent so the Conductor's own pinned cursor is
        healed (the threshold guard keeps live turns untouched). When
