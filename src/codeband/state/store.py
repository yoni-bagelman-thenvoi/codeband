"""SQLite-backed durable state store (RFC Workstream 1).

A single local SQLite database at ``{workspace_path}/state/orchestration.db``
holds four tables:

* ``tasks`` — one row per task (keyed by ``room_id``).
* ``subtask_states`` — one row per ``(task_id, subtask_id)``, its current FSM
  state plus assignment / PR / metadata. Subtask identity is task-scoped:
  planners number subtasks ``st-1``, ``st-2``, … fresh per plan, so a bare
  ``subtask_id`` is NOT unique across tasks in a reused DB.
* ``transition_log`` — append-only audit of every state transition, keyed by
  ``(task_id, subtask_id)`` like the rows it audits. Hash-chained (Stage-3):
  every row carries ``prev_hash`` / ``row_hash`` over a canonical serialization
  of its business columns, so an after-the-fact edit of any row breaks the
  chain at exactly that point (``cb verify-log`` / the watchdog's integrity
  rung detect it).
* ``audit_log`` — append-only, separately hash-chained record of effects that
  are NOT FSM transitions (approval grants, approval-request markers,
  ``pr_number`` bindings, the ``ungated_external_merge`` event). Kept distinct
  from ``transition_log`` so the watchdog's transition patrols keep their
  "FSM transitions only" semantics; grant history is append-only here even
  though the live grant columns on ``subtask_states`` stay current-state.

**Tamper-evidence, not tamper-proofing.** The hash chains make accidental
corruption and after-the-fact edits *detectable* (detection over prevention).
They are NOT a defense against a motivated process with write access to the
DB file — such a process can recompute the whole chain. That is the adversary
line we deliberately do not defend; see the Stage-3 design posture.

Design notes:

* **stdlib only.** Built on :mod:`sqlite3`; no third-party dependency.
* **WAL + short atomic transactions.** Each public method opens a fresh,
  short-lived connection in WAL mode with a busy timeout, so multiple
  processes sharing one workspace (``run_local`` and the distributed
  ``agent_main`` path both point at the same file) can read and write
  concurrently without corruption. WAL lets readers proceed during a write.
* **Idempotent schema.** Tables are created with ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`` on init, so constructing a ``StateStore`` against a fresh or an
  existing DB is always safe.

Only the Workstream-1 surface lives here: ``create_task``,
``ensure_subtask``, ``get_task``, ``get_subtask`` and ``list_active_subtasks``.
The ``transition_log`` table is created but written by the FSM
(``state/fsm.py``, Workstream 2), which also promotes ``tasks.status`` to
``'completed'`` when a task's last subtask merges; this module never enforces
transitions.

# serialization (``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)`` → UTF-8) of the row's
# business columns PLUS the previous row's ``row_hash``. The first row's
# ``prev_hash`` is the genesis constant. Recomputing the chain over the stored

# column break the chain at exactly that row. This is tamper-EVIDENT, not
# tamper-proof: a process that can write the DB can recompute the chain.
