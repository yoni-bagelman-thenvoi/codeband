    ``thenvoi`` builds ``PHXChannelsClient`` with its default

    reconnect loop and creates a fresh Agent per cycle. Letting the Phoenix
    client also reconnect in the background creates competing lifecycle
    owners: ``agent.run()`` returns while PHX reconnect tasks can still be
    alive, which causes duplicate reconnect attempts and topic subscription
    races. Until the SDK exposes this as a public option, patch the local
    process to create PHX clients with ``auto_reconnect=False``.

    The SDK also assumes each Agent owns its process: every PHX client
    registers process signal handlers, and RoomPresence auto-joins existing
    room topics during startup. Those are reasonable defaults for one agent
    per process, but unsafe/noisy when plain ``cb`` runs the full fleet in
    one event loop. In local mode Codeband owns signals, and the startup
    room sweep is replaced with a store-scoped serial sweep: rooms tied to
    an ``active`` task in the StateStore are rejoined (mid-task recovery —
    the SDK then drains their backlog through rehydrated context), stale
    rooms are skipped (caps the backlog-storm blast radius), and a store
    failure subscribes ALL participant rooms — fail toward connectivity,
    never toward deafness. ``cb run --fresh`` skips the sweep entirely.

    Scope: this patch exists for the IN-PROCESS fleet — competing lifecycle
    owners and shared signal handlers — and is local-mode only. Distributed

) -> None:
    """Export ``CODEBAND_PROJECT_DIR`` for every session this process spawns.

    ``role`` (Stage-3 attribution): when given, also exports
    ``CODEBAND_ROLE=<role>`` on this process so every spawned session inherits
    it. This is the same seam that #46 used for ``CODEBAND_AGENT_SESSION``. It
    is only meaningful in **distributed mode** (``run_agent``), where the
    process IS a single role — local ``run_local`` runs every role in one
    process, so there is no single role to export and ``CODEBAND_ROLE`` stays
    unset (the operator-like, ungated path; cb-phase role gating treats unset
    as allowed). Like the session marker, this is an accident guard / forensic
    marker, not authentication.

    The coder/reviewer/mergemaster CLI sessions (Claude Code / Codex
    subprocesses spawned by the adapters, which already receive their ``cwd``
    from the runner) inherit this process's environment — exporting here is
    the one seam that injects the resolved project dir into every spawned
    session, local and supervised alike. ``cb-phase`` and ``cb approve``
    resolve their project dir from this variable when no explicit
    ``--project-dir`` is given (see ``cli/handoff.py:resolve_project_dir``),
    so prompts pass no new flags and agents stop depending on their cwd
    happening to be the project dir. Docker sets the same variable to
    ``/app/config`` in the compose env block.

    ``CODEBAND_AGENT_SESSION`` rides the same seam: every spawned agent
    session inherits it, and ``cb approve`` refuses to record a grant when it
    is set. This is an ACCIDENT GUARD, not authentication — it stops an agent
    from reflexively shelling out to the human-approval primitive (finding
    18); a motivated process can trivially unset it. Real identity binding is
    a design-session concern. The interactive shell's ``/approve`` runs in
    this same process (bare ``cb`` hosts the orchestrator in-process), so the
    guard exempts ``command_style="slash"`` — that path is only reachable
    from the human at the REPL prompt.

    ``agent_id`` (item-0 identity plumbing) rides the same seam in DISTRIBUTED
    mode, where the process IS one Band agent: it is exported as
    ``CODEBAND_AGENT_ID`` so the spawned ``cb-phase`` subprocess can stamp the
    durable ``assigned_worker`` / ``assigned_reviewer`` fields with the real
    agent_id (``codeband/identity.py``). When ``agent_id`` is NOT given (local
    ``run_local``, where one process hosts every role and there is no single
    identity) the var is actively CLEARED — a non-empty ``CODEBAND_AGENT_ID``
    must reliably mean "single distributed agent", so a stale/inherited value
    cannot hijack local-mode resolution (which falls through to the
    worktree/scratch location map instead). Like the role marker, this is a
    forensic / mention aid, not authentication.
